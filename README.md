# Mobile application data for activity generation (MAD4AG)

This project presents a novel methodology that generates individuals' daily activity-travel plans using mobile phone application data. Mobile phone application data is a relatively new big data source and captures individuals' broad range of activities over multiple days with extensive population coverage, which is often challenging with conventional data collection methods. The data comprises anonymized geolocation information collected from location-enabled applications in mobile phones. Although the potential of the mobile application data is immense, it also presents significant challenges, including sampling biases, data gaps due to user inactivity, and the absence of socio-demographic variables.
