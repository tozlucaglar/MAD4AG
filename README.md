# Mobile application data for activity generation (MAD4AG)

This project investigates techniques for generating activity schedules through the integration of travel surveys and passive data from mobile applications. Mobile Application Data, through the passive logging of users' locations, produces a sizable dataset, while travel surveys offer a smaller yet comprehensive set. The objective is to enhance the activity scheduling methodology by harmonizing these sources and extract valuable insights into mobility patterns.
