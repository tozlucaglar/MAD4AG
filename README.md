# Mobile application data for activity generation (MAD4AG)

This project presents a novel methodology that generates individuals' daily activity-travel plans using mobile phone application data. Mobile phone application data is a relatively new big data source and valuable in transportation studies due to the precise location information and broad population coverage over extended periods. While previous research has demonstrated the benefits of similar datasets, such as call detail records (CDRs), for exploring daily mobility patterns, the use of mobile phone application data in activity-based models is under-explored, and their significant challenges havenâ€™t been fully addressed, such as data sparsity, which limit the production of representative activity-travel patterns.
